# Public Interest Data: Ethics & Practice (2024)

The primary class content is maintained in canvas this spring. This repo will keep materials for R slides and for team projects to be published online.

## About 
This course is intended to provide students experience with data science within a framework of data ethics in service of equity-oriented public policy. Our primary goals are:

* Make progress on projects that advance social justice and policy understanding in collaboration with community partners and create work you can point to as part of your portfolio.
* Practice working with real data to answer pressing questions with attention to the moral and ethical implications of our work. This includes finding, cleaning, and understanding data; exploring, analyzing, modeling data; visualizing, contextualizing, and communicating data; with care and humility and respect for the affected partners and communities throughout.
* Develop experience in data workflows that support ethical data science, including processes for working collaboratively, openly, inclusively, and reproducibly.

The final projects undertaken by the class are available below. The complete codebase will be added to the repo soon.

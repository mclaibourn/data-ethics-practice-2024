## Data Tables

A variety of packages for generating tables in R

* `kable` and `kableExtra`: build complex, formatted tables, [Learn more](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html)
* `DT`: tables with filtering, sorting, and other interactivity, [Learn more](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)
* `reactable`: tables with filtering, sorting, and other interactivity plus many formatting options, [Learn more](https://glin.github.io/reactable/index.html) -- we'll come back to this one later

## R Markdown: Expanding the YAML

* A YAML header (yet-another-markup-language), offset by `----`
  - A good review of [YAML headers](https://zsmith27.github.io/rmarkdown_crash-course/lesson-4-yaml-headers.html)
  - Additional arguments: (Floating) Table of contents and code folding

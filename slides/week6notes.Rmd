```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Separate
`separate`: Split a single column into multiple columns by separating each cell in the column into a row of cells.

```{r sep, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/tidyr-seperate.png")
```

`separate(df, col = rate, into = c("cases", "pop"), sep = "/")`


## Unite

`unite`: Combine several columns into a single column by uniting their values across rows.

```{r uni, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/tidyr-unite.png")
```

`unite(df, col = year, century:year, sep = "")`

## More Scales

Controlling x,y scales in ggplot

* Discrete scales
  - limits, breaks, labels
  - guides
* Continuous scales
  - limits, breaks, labels
  - transformations
* Scales package: https://scales.r-lib.org/
  - label (e.g., currency, comma, percent)
  - transform
